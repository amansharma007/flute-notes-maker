Flute Notes Maker is a simple static web app using which you can generate flute notes for any sargam. 

# Why use Flute Notes Maker?

Every beginner flute player needs enough time to practice the alankaars (Sa,Re,Ga,Ma,Pa,Dha,Ni,Sa) on the flute. So, if you are eager to learn atleast a song and you don't have the proper practice of Alankaars, then this app will make the exact flute notes for you. You just need to enter the Sargam. 
  

# Use

  - Simply enter the sargam in the input section, for e.g, "srgmpdns" for Sa,Re,Ga,Ma,Pa,Dha,Ni,Sa. Then simply click the button "Generate Notes".
  - If there is a higher note, then you just have to use ' in the input section, for e.g, "s'rgmpdns". There will be a # added to the note in the flute notes, telling you that is a higher note.


You can also:
  - Open the flute notes as an image in a new tab by clicking the button "Open As Image"
  - In the opened tab, just right click on the photo and save it. [Some issues in Chrome - Not able to save the photo.]
